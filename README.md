##Chapter 6 Assignments  

1.  Filling an Array  
Create a procedure that ﬁlls an array of doublewords with N random integers, making sure the
values fall within the range j...k, inclusive. When calling the procedure, pass a pointer to the
array that will hold the data, pass N, and pass the values of j and k. Preserve all register values
between calls to the procedure. Write a test program that calls the procedure twice, using differ-
ent values for j and k. Verify your results using a debugger.  

2.  Summing Array Elements in a Range  
Create a procedure that returns the sum of all array elements falling within the range j...k (inclusive). Write a test program that calls the procedure twice, passing a pointer to a signed double-
word array, the size of the array, and the values of j and k. Return the sum in the EAX register,
and preserve all other register values between calls to the procedure.
